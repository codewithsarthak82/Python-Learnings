# THE FOLLOWIMG ARE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS FROM TUPLE -

numbers = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,89,99999,89,99,89)
print(numbers)

# 1.index method tells us the index of the data entered -
X = numbers.index(7)
print(X)

# 2.count method tells us the count/occurence of the data entered - 
Y = numbers.count(89)
print(Y)

# 3.length tells us about the length of the tuple
Z = numbers.__len__()
print(Z)

# THE FOLLOWING ARE THE ONLY 2 METHODS IN TUPLES !
