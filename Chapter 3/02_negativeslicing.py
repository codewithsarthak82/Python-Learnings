
name = "Sarthak"

print(name[3:7])
print(name[-3:-1]) # (so this is negative number format from strings) 

# IN SUCH CASES WE GENERALLY USE NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE CONVERSION OF STRING
# AND IT MAKES IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND CODE ! (simple and easy)

# example :     S  A  R  T  H  A  K
#              [ 0  1  2  3  4  5  6 ] 
#              (-7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 ) this is conversion
