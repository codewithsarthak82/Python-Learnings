"""This helps user to deal with classes and objects in programming, In simple words
   we can say that Class is a blueprint of an object . Example -
   
   A blank form(without any individul's info) is known as a CLASS
   A filled form(with an individual's info) is known as an OBJECT"""

'''This works on the principle of DRY(Do not repeat yourself) principle. And 
   moreover a class is a TEMPLATE'''

# Therefore, we say that CLASS____Blueprint of an____OBJECT !

"""Syntax of defining a class"""

class Company:
    name = "Sarthak"
    position = "CEO & Founder" 
    salary = 500
